3.  Gap Analysis

3.1.  Bidirectional Links

   Bidirectional links can be modelled as two unidirectional links, one
   for each direction, terminated on the same two termination points, as
   described in Section 4.4.5 of [RFC8345].

   It is worth noting that a bidirectional link can be unambiguously
   distinguished from two unidirectional links between the same two
   nodes since the two unidirectional links will be terminated on
   different termination points, as shown in Figure 1.

Insert a figure showing a bidirectional link supported by two unidirectional links.

     Figure 1: Difference between one bidirectional link and two
                         unidirectional links

      Open issue: discuss whether the bidirectional, which in turn might
      be supported as unidirectional links at the lower layer, is
      modelled using the supporting-link or the underlay path

3.2.  Multipoint Links

   Multipoint links can be modelled as pseudonodes, as described in
   Section 4.4.5 of [RFC8345].

   The type of multipoint link (e.g., point-to-multipoint or multipoint-
   to-multipoint, as defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept]) and the
   role of the termination points in the link (e.g., source,
   destination, hub, spoke, as defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept])
   can be unambiguously understood from the links connecting the
   termination points of the pseudonode and from the 'is-allowed'
   attibute of the connectivity matrix, as defined in [RFC8795], of the
   pseudonode.

      Note: some examples for multipoint links are described in
      Section 2.5 of [I-D.ietf-teas-te-topology-profiles].  More
      examples can be provided in future versions of this document.

3.3.  Multi-domain Links

   Multi-domain links can be represented as open-ended links on each
   topology instance and unambiguously associated as multi-domain links
   using either the remote node ID / link ID attribute or the inter-
   domain-plug-id, as described in Section 4.2 of [RFC8795].

3.4.  Links and nodes down in topology

   [RFC8345] does not explicitly indicate whether links and nodes down
   in the topology should be reported or not.

   [RFC8795] defines the 'oper-status' attribute for nodes, links and
   termination points, therefore allowing to report links and nodes down
   in the topology, and to unambiguously distinguishing between nodes
   and links which are up or down.

3.5.  Multi-Layer Topologies

      Open issue: need some brainstorming for the simple case where
      there is 1:1 mapping from the link in the client layer and the
      link in the server layer

3.6.  Termination points supported by physical devices

   [RFC8345] does not limit the type of components that can support a
   termination point.

   The mapping between a termination point and an inventory component is
   under definition in [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology].

   In the current version of [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology],
   a termination point can only be mappted to a port component.
   However, if needed, the IVY WG could update
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology] to allow a termination
   point to be mapped to any type of component.

      Open issue: need further discussion since the example provided in
      [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept] is the IP loopback interface which
      cannot be mapped to a port component.  However, the IP loopback
      interface is logical interface where IP packets are terminated
      (layer transition) so it is worthwhile discussing whether it is
      mapped as a termination point or as a tunnel termination point, as
      defined in [RFC8795].

4.  Design Considerations

      I think it would be worthwhile describing the possibility to
      transform the data model exposed by a network controller into an
      application-specific data model to be consumed by the application.

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

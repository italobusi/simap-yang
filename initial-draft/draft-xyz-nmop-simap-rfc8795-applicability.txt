1.  Introduction

   The concept of Service & Infrastructure Maps (SIMAP) is being defined
   in [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept] together with a set of SIMP
   requirements and use cases.

   SIMAP is defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept], as:

      SIMAP is a data model that provides a topological view of the
      operator's networks and services, including how it is connected to
      other models (e.g., inventory) and external data sources (e.g.,
      observability data, and operational knowledge).  This model
      represents a multi-layered topology and offers mechanisms to
      navigate amongst layers and correlate between them.  This includes
      layers from physical topology to service topology.  This model is
      applicable to multiple domains (access, core, data center, etc.)
      and technologies (Optical, IP, etc.).

   It is worth noting that the YANG data model in [RFC8795] defines a
   topology model which:

   *  represents a multi-layered topology;

   *  offers mechanisms to navigate amongst layers and correlate between
      them;

   *  is applicable to multiple domains (access, core, data center,
      etc.) and technologies (Optical, IP, etc.).

   [I-D.ietf-teas-te-topology-profiles] clarifies that

   It is therefore worthwhile analyzing the applicability of the YANG
   data model in [RFC8795] to meet the SIMAP requirements and identify
   any gaps that need to be addressed before starting the work on new
   YANG data models to meet the SIMAP requirements, as outlined in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept].

   Understanding the degree of standardization and identifying potential
   gaps are crucial for supporting the SIMAP applications while ensuring
   multi-vendor interoperability and compatibility with other
   applications which can run on top of the same network controller.

3.  Gap Analysis

3.1.  Bidirectional Links

   Bidirectional links can be modelled as two unidirectional links, one
   for each direction, terminated on the same two termination points, as
   described in Section 4.4.5 of [RFC8345].

   It is worth noting that a bidirectional link can be unambiguously
   distinguished from two unidirectional links between the same two
   nodes since the two unidirectional links will be terminated on
   different termination points, as shown in Figure 1.

                            unidirectional links

3.2.  Multipoint Links

   Multipoint links can be modelled as pseudonodes, as described in
   Section 4.4.5 of [RFC8345].

   The type of multipoint link (e.g., point-to-multipoint or multipoint-
   to-multipoint, as defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept]) and the
   role of the termination points in the link (e.g., source,
   destination, hub, spoke, as defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept])
   can be unambiguously understood from the links connecting the
   termination points of the pseudonode and from the 'is-allowed'
   attibute of the connectivity matrix, as defined in [RFC8795], of the
   pseudonode.

      Note: some examples for multipoint links are described in
      Section 2.5 of [I-D.ietf-teas-te-topology-profiles].  More
      examples can be provided in future versions of this document.

3.3.  Links and nodes down in topology

   [RFC8795] defines the 'oper-status' attribute for nodes, links and
   termination points, therefore allowing to report links and nodes down
   in the topology, and to unambiguously distinguishing between nodes
   and links which are up or down.

3.4.  Multi-Layer Topologies

   As outlined in Section 2 of [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept]:

      [RFC8345] is flexible and can support both the same network
      topology instance with multiple layers (e.g., Layer 2 and Layer 3)
      or separate network topology instances with supporting relations
      between them (e.g., separate Layer 2 and Layer 3).  Therefore,
      multiple topology layers can be grouped into the same network
      topology instance, if solution requires.

   [RFC8795] augments [RFC8345] and therefore provide the same
   flexibility.

   As described in Section 3 of [I-D.havel-nmop-simap-yang]: > -
   Layering relationships are expressed solely through the supporting
   construct, without additional semantics such as underlay, primary,
   backup, load-sharing, path, sequential, or parallel roles.

   This issue was taken into account when designing the YANG data model
   in [RFC8795] and the 'underlay' relationship has been properly
   defined to support navigation between overlay and underlay layers, as
   described in Section 2.3 of [I-D.ietf-teas-te-topology-profiles].

   Some guidelines on how to unambiguously use the supporting
   relationship, defined in [RFC8345], and the 'underlay' relationship
   defined in [RFC8795], have been clarified in Section 2.3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-te-topology-profiles].

   As outlined in REQ-BIDIR of [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept], a
   bidirectional link can be supported by two unidirectional links in
   the lower layer.  For example, a Ethernet (bidirectional) link can be
   supported by two physical layer links associated with two
   unidirectional fibers.

   This relationship can be modelled using the link 'underlay'
   relationship: in this case each link is supported by a primary path
   composed by a single link.

3.5.  Multi-domain Links

   Multi-domain links can be represented as open-ended links on each
   topology instance and unambiguously associated as multi-domain links
   using either the remote node ID / link ID attribute or the inter-
   domain-plug-id, as described in Section 4.2 of [RFC8795].

3.6.  Multi-domain Nodes

      Open issue: need further discussion about how to model the inter-
      area border nodes when belonging to different network topologies
      (one for each area)

3.7.  Termination points supported by physical devices

   [RFC8345] does not limit the type of components that can support a
   termination point.

   The mapping between a termination point and an inventory component is
   under definition in [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology].

   In the current version of [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology],
   a termination point can only be mappted to a port component.
   However, if needed, the IVY WG could update
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology] to allow a termination
   point to be mapped to any type of component.

      Open issue: need further discussion since the example provided in
      [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept] is the IP loopback interface which
      cannot be mapped to a port component.  However, the IP loopback
      interface is logical interface where IP packets are terminated
      (layer transition) so it is worthwhile discussing whether it is
      mapped as a termination point or as a tunnel termination point, as
      defined in [RFC8795].

4.  Design Considerations

   Reusing existing YANG data models to support multiple applications is
   a key enabler to achieve multi-vendor interoperability.

   A network controller needs to support multiple applications (some of
   which may not be defined at the time the network controller is
   defined) and different applications have different requirements on
   the data model they use internally to perform their tasks.

   Exposing application-specific data models at the northbound of a
   network controller appears making the application simpler to
   implement when it is the only application to be implemented on top of
   a given controller but results in more complex implementations for
   network controllers and the applications and increase complexity to
   achieve multi-vendor interoperability and integration.

   Figure 2 shows a case where a controller-A is interfacing an
   Application-1 through the application-specific data model designed
   for Application-1 (i.e., AS1-DM) and a controller-B is interfacing
   another Application-2 through the application-specific data model
   designed for Application-2 (i.e., AS2-DM).

                  |   /                           \   |
           AS1-DM |  /                             \  | AS2-DM
                  | /                               \ |

     +-------------------------+         +-------------------------+

     Figure 2: Concerns with defining application-specific data models

   The two application-specific data models can provide the same
   information but with different formatting.  For example,
   Application-1 may need to model bidirectional links as a single
   entity (link of type bidirectional) while Application-2 may need to
   model bidirectional links as two unidirectional links.

   This solution works well as long as Application-1 and controller-A
   are deployed in different silos than Application-2 and controller-B.
   Otherwise, operational and implementation issues have to be faces
   when there is the need to run Application-1 over network controller-B
   or, Application-2 over network controller-A.

   This would require the operator to negotiate with the vendor and
   controller vendors customized solutions before integrating a new
   application or a new controller in the network and increased
   complexity in the application and network controller implementations.

   Figure 3 describes an architecture based on a common and standardized
   data model to support multi-vendor integration.

      Figure 3: Use of a common and standardized data model to support
                          multi-vendor integration

   In this case, the data model exposed by network controllers (e.g.,
   controller-A and controller-B) is the same and each application needs
   to translate/map the standardized data model exposed by the network
   controller to its own application-specific data model.

   Following this approach an existing application (e.g., Application-1)
   can be ported from one controller to another controller (e.g., from
   controller-A to controller-B) ideally with no change and additional
   testing.

   Reusing RFC8795 YANG data model for SIMAP applications will allow TE
   and SIMAP application to co-exist on top of the same network
   controller, allowing seamless migration from network scenarios
   supporting only on of these application to network scenarios where
   both applications are supported at the same time or even scenarios
   where either or both applications are supported together with new
   applications not yet defined.

Appendix A.  Example of deviation statements

   [I-D.ietf-teas-te-topology-profiles] indicates that the YANG
   deviation mechanism is not applicable for TE topology profiles since
   the profiles to be supported may be different on different instances,
   depending also on other attributes (e.g., the network type).

   Existing implementations of [RFC8795] describes the implemented
   profiled by manually pruning the YANG tree generated fom the YANG
   module defined in [RFC8795].  The pruned YANG tree was sufficient to
   the implementers to generate proper APIs.

   However, it is possible to use the YANG deviation statements to
   programmatically generate a profiled YANG tree.

   An example of a YANG deviation module for SIMAP applications is
   provided below.

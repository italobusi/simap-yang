3.  Gap Analysis

3.1.  Bidirectional Links

   Bidirectional links can be modelled as two unidirectional links, one
   for each direction, terminated on the same two termination points, as
   described in Section 4.4.5 of [RFC8345].

   It is worth noting that a bidirectional link can be unambiguously
   distinguished from two unidirectional links between the same two
   nodes since the two unidirectional links will be terminated on
   different termination points, as shown in Figure 1.

   Insert a figure showing a bidirectional link supported by two
   unidirectional links.

   See slide 1 of: https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25503362
                         /simap-applicability.pptx

        Figure 1: Difference between one bidirectional link and two
                            unidirectional links

      Open issue: discuss whether the bidirectional, which in turn might
      be supported as unidirectional links at the lower layer, is
      modelled using the supporting-link or the underlay path.  Agreed
      in the 2026-02-20 TE call: use the underlay path and reference
      section 2.3.1 of the TE topology profile.

3.2.  Multipoint Links

   Multipoint links can be modelled as pseudonodes, as described in
   Section 4.4.5 of [RFC8345].

   The type of multipoint link (e.g., point-to-multipoint or multipoint-
   to-multipoint, as defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept]) and the
   role of the termination points in the link (e.g., source,
   destination, hub, spoke, as defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept])
   can be unambiguously understood from the links connecting the
   termination points of the pseudonode and from the 'is-allowed'
   attibute of the connectivity matrix, as defined in [RFC8795], of the
   pseudonode.

      Note: some examples for multipoint links are described in
      Section 2.5 of [I-D.ietf-teas-te-topology-profiles].  More
      examples can be provided in future versions of this document.

3.3.  Multi-domain Links

   Multi-domain links can be represented as open-ended links on each
   topology instance and unambiguously associated as multi-domain links
   using either the remote node ID / link ID attribute or the inter-
   domain-plug-id, as described in Section 4.2 of [RFC8795].

3.4.  Links and nodes down in topology

   [RFC8795] defines the 'oper-status' attribute for nodes, links and
   termination points, therefore allowing to report links and nodes down
   in the topology, and to unambiguously distinguishing between nodes
   and links which are up or down.

3.5.  Multi-Layer Topologies

      Open issue: need some brainstorming for the simple case where
      there is 1:1 mapping from the link in the client layer and the
      link in the server layer

3.6.  Termination points supported by physical devices

   [RFC8345] does not limit the type of components that can support a
   termination point.

   The mapping between a termination point and an inventory component is
   under definition in [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology].

   In the current version of [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology],
   a termination point can only be mappted to a port component.
   However, if needed, the IVY WG could update
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-topology] to allow a termination
   point to be mapped to any type of component.

      Open issue: need further discussion since the example provided in
      [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept] is the IP loopback interface which
      cannot be mapped to a port component.  However, the IP loopback
      interface is logical interface where IP packets are terminated
      (layer transition) so it is worthwhile discussing whether it is
      mapped as a termination point or as a tunnel termination point, as
      defined in [RFC8795].

4.  Design Considerations

   Reusing existing YANG data models to support multiple applications is
   a key enabler to achieve multi-vendor interoperability.

   A network controller needs to support multiple applications (some of
   which may not be defined at the time the network controller is
   defined) and different applications have different requirements on
   the data model they use internally to perform their tasks.

   Exposing application-specific data models at the northbound of a
   network controller appears making the application simpler to
   implement when it is the only application to be implemented on top of
   a given controller but results in more complex implementations for
   network controllers and the applications and increase complexity to
   achieve multi-vendor interoperability and integration.

   Figure 2 shows a case where a controller-A is interfacing an
   Application-1 through the application-specific data model designed
   for Application-1 (i.e., AS1-DM) and a controller-B is interfacing
   another Application-2 through the application-specific data model
   designed for Application-2 (i.e., AS2-DM).

   Insert a figure showing two applications interacting with two
   controllers using application specific data models.

   See slide 2 of: https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25503362
                         /simap-applicability.pptx

     Figure 2: Concerns with defining application-specific data models

   The two application-specific data models can provide the same
   information but with different formatting.  For example,
   Application-1 may need to model bidirectional links as a single
   entity (link of type bidirectional) while Application-2 may need to
   model bidirectional links as two unidirectional links.

   This solution works well as long as Application-1 and controller-A
   are deployed in different silos than Application-2 and controller-B.
   Otherwise, operational and implementation issues have to be faces
   when there is the need to run Application-1 over network controller-B
   or, Application-2 over network controller-A.

   This would require the operator to negotiate with the vendor and
   controller vendors customized solutions before integrating a new
   application or a new controller in the network and increased
   complexity in the application and network controller implementations.

   Figure 3 describes an architecture based on a common and standardized
   data model to support multi-vendor integration.

   Insert a figure showing two applications interacting with two
   controllers using a common standardized data model.

   See slide 3 of: https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25503362
                         /simap-applicability.pptx

      Figure 3: Use of a common and standardized data model to support
                          multi-vendor integration

   In this case, the data model exposed by network controllers (e.g.,
   controller-A and controller-B) is the same and each application needs
   to translate/map the standardized data model exposed by the network
   controller to its own application-specific data model.

   Following this approach an existing application (e.g., Application-1)
   can be ported from one controller to another controller (e.g., from
   controller-A to controller-B) ideally with no change and additional
   testing.

   Reusing RFC8795 YANG data model for SIMAP applications will allow TE
   and SIMAP application to co-exist on top of the same network
   controller, allowing seamless migration from network scenarios
   supporting only on of these application to network scenarios where
   both applications are supported at the same time or even scenarios
   where either or both applications are supported together with new
   applications not yet defined.

Appendix A.  Example of deviation statements

      how to do a coarse grain profiling of TE topology.

      Action: investigate if it is possible to generate simple APIs from
      the YANG data model using the deviations
